                <h1>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h1>
                <p>
                    We believe that Art is a gateway to a better, more 
                    beautiful side of the world, inspired by the dynamic and 
                    abstract way of thinking one must have to bring an idea 
                    onto the canvas. Our Art is about executing those thoughts 
                    clearly and vividly in a way that it expresses who we are, 
                    without needing an explanation as to why it came to be in 
                    the first place. Art should have no rules or limits, and 
                    here at EPIC Art we hope to inspire you to put your heart into 
                    the work that you create. We will happily refund anyone not 
                    satisfied with our services, and encourage you to leave 
                    feedback on your experiences with us so that we can continue 
                    to grow and inspire you as best as we can.
