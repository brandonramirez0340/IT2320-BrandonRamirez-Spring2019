                            As a child Monika could be seen traipsing through 
                            the wooded trails of her home city of Brentwood, 
                            Tennessee. Monika was never far from nature or 
                            the little critters that lived in it, and often 
                            brought these animals home with her to keep as 
                            pets. However, from mudpies and bugs to the 
                            prestige halls of Yale, Monika evolved from her 
                            tomboyish childhood into an exemplary student of 
                            the Arts who excelled in all her courses. She was 
                            an active member in her Sorority and received her 
                            Master's degree at the age of twenty-six. In her 
                            spare time Monika likes to play her harp in her 
                            herb garden alongside her cat, Jasper. She also 
                            enjoys cooking and often hosts dinner parties for 
                            her friends and colleagues accompanied by musical 
                            pieces she's written and artistically crafted hors 
                            d'oevres. When she has time off, Monika likes to 
                            travel to foreign countries with her fianc√© and 
                            expand her photography collection.

                        <p><a href="mailto:gustavfredrickson@epicart.com">gustavfredrickson@epicart.com</a></p>
                        <p>
                            Gustav was born and raised in the bustling city of 
                            Munich, Germany. From a young age, Gustav showed a 
                            vivid interest in the arts, and excelled in all his 
                            studies. When he was fourteen, he and his parents 
                            immigrated to America and settled in Fayetteville, 
                            West Virginia. Despite having to overcome the 
                            challenges of transferring to a new school with 
                            only a mild grasp on English, Gustav proved his 
                            proficiency and willingness to persevere and 
                            overcome. By the age of eighteen he had been 
                            offered a scholarship at the Rhode Island School 
                            of Design where he studied until he received his 
                            Master's Degree in Fine Arts. From there Gustav 
                            officially began his career as an artist and made 
                            a name for himself amongst the greats, earning 
                            his art a place in several museums. Furthermore, 
                            Gustav is an active member of and partner of WWF, 
                            husband to Catherine and father to Hannah and 
                            Lionel, as well as an avid fisher, vlogger, and 
                            environmental activist.

                            Theresa, age 36, grew up in Houston, Texas with 
                            her parents, four siblings, and grandmother. Now 
                            having four kids of her own, one of which has 
                            special needs, she understands the creativity and 
                            imagination of a child as well as the need for 
                            patience better than anyone, making her the most 
                            qualified to handle our Art for Tots class. When 
                            she isn't pursuing her passion in teaching you can 
                            find this southern woman bustling about the kitchen 
                            concocting a new recipe, over one of her favorite 
                            romantic novels, or clipping coupons to fuel her 
                            couponing hobby. She also shares a passion for 
                            cross-stitching, sewing, and knitting which she 
                            can sometimes be seen working on during lunch 
                            breaks.

                            Edmund, or Eddie as he's more commonly known to 
                            those close to him, is a man who sees the world 
                            through rose colored glasses; his relaxed and 
                            abstract approach to life comes from his abuelito. 
                            Eddie was raised by his grandfather from the age 
                            of four when his mother passed away from lung 
                            cancer in his hometown of Stockton, California. 
                            Though times were hard, Eddie's grandfather 
                            encouraged and taught him to see the good side 
                            of everything rather than the bad, but at 
                            seventeen years old Eddie's grandfather passed 
                            away. From that point in his life he made the 
                            decision to change his career path and start 
                            something that would inspire people. He graduated 
                            high school, moved to Fresno, California, and 
                            there he began putting his emotions onto canvas 
                            in honor of his grandfather. Eddie sold his 
                            creations on the streets of Fresno for years 
                            until his name became popular in the area and 
                            he made enough money to put himself through art 
                            school. Now twenty-seven, Eddie teaches at EPIC 
                            Art Studio with a bachelor's degree and a desire 
                            to spread his grandfather's good will and kind 
                            spirit to his students.

                        <p>
                            Even as a kid Ben has always put his family first, 
                            and art was a gateway for him to show his love 
                            and appreciation to those he cared about. Whether 
                            it was macaroni sculptures, crayola masterpieces, 
                            or dying his poodle with kool-aid, Ben always found 
                            a way to bring color and imagination to his and 
                            everyone else's world. He led a relatively normal 
                            life alongside his sister, Pamela, who never failed 
                            to find trouble for the two of them when they were 
                            together. As he got older, Ben found himself fixing 
                            vehicles alongside his father who owned a local 
                            automotive repair shop, and there he spent most 
                            of his teenage years learning how cars worked and 
                            what it took to repair them, but he never had a 
                            passion for it. It was only when Ben entered his 
                            thirties and met his down-to-earth wife, Samantha 
                            that he truly realized what he wanted to do. 
                            Now close to a decade later of hard work and 
                            schooling, Ben once again spreads his love of 
                            art to people.
